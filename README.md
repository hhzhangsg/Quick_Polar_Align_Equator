# Quick_Polar_Align_Equator
As the title. Defy the disadvantage equator (or near) region for polar alignment

When it comes to polar alignment of precious instrument of equatorial mount, amateur astronomers in the earth's equator region are crying.

The northern hemisphere amateurs are blessed with the nature's giving of a bright polar star. A great deal of tools can pin point its location relative to the true north celestrial pole within 1deg distance.

The southern hemisphere amtaeurs are less advantagous and they have to settle the alignment using a few faint stars in the Octans constellation. But, better than nothing.

Nothing in either celestrial polar fields is accessible to us in the equator region. A usual way is to rough align the mount using whatever means and then use the drift alignment technique to precisely aim the mount axis to celestrial pole. Drift alignment is painstaking, even with the tools like PhD2. Period.

Adding to the pain is the fact that everytime an amateur astronomer stares at the electronics polar scope bundled with the mount and deciding whether to let it go (hey, who in the region wants it anyway?), or keep it as a scar mark of the hurt by the poor geological location?

No.... 

This project aims to defy all this disadvantages and make polar alignment quick and easy for equator region users of EQ mounts.

Hmm, is that possible? 

The project is my answer. Target is to set up the gear and align it reasonably well (within 5' !) within 10 minutes!
